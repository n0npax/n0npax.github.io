# Before making any big decisions let's consider given topics:

* Corectness
  * What can we do, to ensure system will work as expected
* Learnability
  * Engineers are not cheap. How long will it take to learn systems and create mental model for new-hire?
* Agility
  * How hard it will be to change scope of work
* Testability
  * How can we proof system works as expected.
  * How can we proof `e2e` is checking proper domains
* Elasticity
* Deployability
  * Is deployment process reproducible and easy
* Development lifecycle
  * Is process of building new puzzles known and structured? 
* Performance
  * Do you care about performance? What is traffic estimation?
* Scalability
  * How will you and your dependency will scale
* Availability
* Reliability
* Security
  * Will any bridge be a disaster for company and customers?
* Recoverability
  * How to recover system in case of environment failure?
* Fault tolerance
  * Which kind of outage are we expecting
* Scalability
* Auditability
* Data
  * storing (what can we store: GDPR)
  * processing (what can we do)
