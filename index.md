## `whoami`

Hi, I'm [Marcin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcin-niemira-4a826a104/). I'm a software engineer who started his own journey at 13yo. My 1st Linux (mandriva) was broken all the times, but learned me to read error messages and not copy-paste random commands form the internet. I finished my master degree on [PWR](http://weka.pwr.edu.pl/en/) in Poland. During the study I was member of student [organization](https://asi.wroclaw.pl/) where I meet some geeks who were always keen to dig deeper. As student I was working in Nokia. I learned that scale (40K containers) brings more challenges in OVH. After few years I decided to move to Australia to play with ðŸ¦˜, and here I am.
