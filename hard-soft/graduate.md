# Graduate road map

If you are a student or graduate you may be thinking what to do to accelerate your career and how to find 1st job or internship.

Base on my own mistakes I can give you few advices:

## Tech skills

* It's better to learn one programming language well then have average skills in 5.
  * Read a book. The long one. At least 1K pages which covers advanced topics
  * do a project. Store it in github and keep quality as good as you can. This may be treated as a sample of your code which will be reviewed.
* Read a books about craftsmanship in example [Clean code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/). 
* Read some books about design.
* If you can try to contribute to some open source project. Maintainers will give you proper code review
  * write tests or minor bugfixes.

## Resume
You are starting, so probably there is not to much you can show, but:

* Put all your projects with description what has beed done and how. In example:
```
Rating system for coffee shops in Bendigo (link)
backend:
* Java, Spring, JPA
Frontend:
* React
```
* If project was a group project, describe which part was done by you.

### Always

* Make it as clear as possible
* Describe what was your achievements & responsibilities
* Describe your tech stack.
* Don't lie. Overestimation can happen, but saying you have an expertise with Rust can be easily checked.
* Check for any typos and double check email and phone number.
* Be descriptive. Fact you know python doesn't mean you know pandas. Adding set of frameworks & libraries you are familiar to may be useful.
* Sometimes 1st check is done by non technical people who are looking for keywords.

## Apply

* Just apply!
* Many companies are sending coding challenge. Do it, send it back and wait for review.
  * Don't cheat. 2nd round will be harder. If coding was done by your friend, you will just fail
* No risk - no fun

## On the interview

* Don't stress. You don't have to do everything perfect. Interviewer is also a human.
* Interview has 2 main goals (in this order):
  1. Check how do you solve the problem
  2. Check your technical skills
* Ask questions and clarify given issue. If you are asked to design system, ask for estimated number of users.
* Be on time. I mean few minutes earlier.
  * In case you are 5min late because tram was late you are giving bad impression - who cares, but still
  * You gonna be given exactly the same questions and challenge. Instead of 60min of coding, you have just 55 now. 10% less. You may need this time.

## In case of Failure

You failed because of [...]. Improve and retry. Next time it gonna be a little bit better. Live is kind of `SDLC`
